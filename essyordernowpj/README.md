 Data Engineering Project README

 Project Overview

As a data engineer, I am working on a project that involves extracting data from a MongoDB API using Python. The project includes several key steps: data extraction, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data storage on AWS S3 buckets. This README provides an overview of the project's objectives, workflow, and key components.
 Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this data engineering project are as follows:

1. Data Extraction: Extract data from a MongoDB API using Python. This includes retrieving relevant data from MongoDB collections for further processing.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks using Python and the Pandas library. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis and storage.
3. Data Storage on AWS S3: Create three separate AWS S3 buckets to store different stages of the data:
    A bucket for raw data as extracted from the MongoDB API.
    A bucket for cleaned and transformed data after preprocessing.
    A bucket for aggregated data, which may include summary statistics or other derived information.

 Project Workflow
The project follows the following workflow:
 Data Extraction
In the data extraction phase, I use Python to connect to the MongoDB API and retrieve the necessary data. This step involves querying MongoDB collections, fetching documents, and preparing the data for further processing. To accomplish this, I use Python's MongoDB client libraries and establish a connection to the MongoDB server.

 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Data cleaning and preprocessing are crucial to ensure data quality and suitability for analysis. This phase involves tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and performing any necessary transformations. Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, is used to efficiently handle these tasks.

 Data Storage on AWS S3

To facilitate data storage and management, the project leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS). Three distinct S3 buckets are created to organize and store data at different stages of processing. These buckets include:

 Raw Data Bucket: This bucket houses the original data extracted from MongoDB. It serves as a historical record of the raw data.

 Cleaned and Transformed Data Bucket: Once data cleaning and preprocessing are complete, the cleaned and transformed data is stored in this bucket. This data is ready for analysis and reporting.

 Aggregated Data Bucket: If there is a need for aggregating data, such as computing statistics or aggregating information for reports, the results are stored in this bucket. This bucket may also include summaries or aggregated datasets used for visualization and analytics.

 Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

 Python: Ensure you have Python installed, along with necessary libraries like `pymongo` for MongoDB interaction and `pandas` for data manipulation.

 AWS Account: You will need an AWS account and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or Ubuntu configured with necessary access rights to create and manage S3 buckets.

 MongoDB Connection: Make sure you have the connection details for the MongoDB API, including the connection URL, database name, and relevant collections.


 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Set up your Python environment with the required dependencies. You can do this by running `pip install r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials to access your AWS S3 buckets.

4. Update the Python scripts and configuration files as needed for your specific project requirements.

5. Run the Python scripts to perform data extraction, cleaning, preprocessing, and storage on AWS S3.

 Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

 `data_extraction.py`: Python script for data extraction from MongoDB.
 `data_cleaning.py`: Python script for data cleaning and preprocessing.
 `transformamtion.py`: Python script for interacting with AWS S3 buckets.
 `config.json`: Configuration file containing parameters for the project.
 `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
